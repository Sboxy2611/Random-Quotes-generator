# Random-Quotes-generator
This HTML/CSS/JavaScript code creates a webpage that displays a random motivational quote. It has a styled container with a title, a paragraph for the quote, and a button. Clicking the button (or on initial load) triggers JavaScript to randomly select a quote from a predefined array and update the paragraph's text.
